PHELP is a template for a “roll your own” password helper. The idea is to use one master password, and salt it with username, site info, and custom salt. Naturally, making the guesswork of bruteforcing passwords easier eliminates the time to break in, so this can be reversed somewhat by misspelling site names or account names. Salt values can be alphanumeric. And your final password generation procedure should be your own.
